title: "A.M. Campbell"

I find that I am consistently referring friends to the same books, articles, writers, and ideas, not always because the various materials represent  my views, but usually because I found them valuable in improving my thinking. The primary purpose of this site, then, is to list these materials and to occasionally share my own writing.

This site is a work in progress, as of now the [book recommendations](/recs/books) are what I'm working on most.
