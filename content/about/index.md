I'm a senior at Dartmouth majoring in math and studying to apply to medical school. 

Some things I'm involved in other that my classes: 

- **Sustainable Health Lab:** I'm working on a paper with Prof. Inas Khayal. A lot of python. 
- **Crisis Text Line Volunteering:** I volunteer as a crisis counselor.
- **Running and Lifting:** I completed my frist half marathon this fall and am training for a marathon I will run in the spring.
